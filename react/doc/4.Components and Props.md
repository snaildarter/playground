# Components and Props

_Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pleces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a detiled component API reference here._

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs(called "props") and return React elements descring what should appear on the sereen.

## Function and Class Components

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript funtion:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single "props" (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components "function components" bacause they are literally JavaScript functions.

You can also use an ES6 class to define a component:

```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
    }
}
```

The above two components are equivalent from React's point of view.

Classes have some additional reatures that we will discuss in the next sections. Until then, we will use function components for their conciseness.

## Rendering a Component

Previously, we only encountered React elements that repressent DOM tags:

```jsx
const element = <div />;
```

However, elements can also represent user-defined components:

```jsx
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object. We call this object "props".

For example, this code renders "Hello, Sara" on the page:

```jsx
function Welcome(porps) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara">;

ReactDOM.render(
    element,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Let's recap what happens in this example:

1. We call ReactDOM.render() with the <Welcome name="Sara" /> element.
2. React calls the Welcome component with {name: 'Sara'} as the props.
3. Our Welcome component returns a <h1>Hello, Sara<h1> element as the result.
4. React DOM efficlently updates the DOM to match <h1>Hello, Sara</h1>.

> Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.
>
> React treates components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tage. For example, <div /> represents an HTML div tag, but <Welcome /> represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope.
> 
> To learn more about the reasoning behind this convention. please read JSX in Depath.

## Composing Components

Components can refer to other components in their output. this lets us the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen; in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.

For example, we can create an App component that renders Welcome many times:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Welcome name="Sara">
            <Welcome name="Cahal">
            <Welcome name="Edite">
        </div>
    );
}

ReactDOM.render(
    <App />,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Typically, new React apps have a single App component at the very top. However, if you integrate React into an existing app, you might start bottom-up with a small component like Buttion and gradually work your way to the top of the view hierarchy.

## Extracting Components

Don't be afraid to split components into smaller components.

For example, conside this Comment component:

```jsx
function Commont(props) {
    return (
        <div className="Comment">
            <div className="UserInfo">
                <img className="Avatar"
                    src={props.author.avatarUrl}
                    alt={props.author.name}
                />
                <div className="UserInfo-name">
                    {props.author.name}
                </div>
            <div/>
            <div className="Comment-text">
                {props.text}
            </div>
            <div className="Comment-date">
                {props.date}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

It assepts author (an object), text (a string), and date (a date) as props, and describes a comment on a social media website.

This component can be tricky to change becaused of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse individual parts of it. Let's extract a few components from it.

First, we will extract Avatar:

```jsx
function Avatar(props) {
    return (
        <img className="Avatar" 
            src ={props.user.avatarUrl}
            alt={props.user.name}
        />
    );
}
```

The Avatar doesn't need to know that it is being rendered inside a Comment. This is why we have given its prop a more generic name: user rather than author.

We recommend naming props from the component's own point of view rather the context in which it is being used.

We can now simplify Comment a tiny bit.

```jsx
function Comment(props) {
    return (
        <div className="Comment">
            <div className="UserInfo">
                <Avatar user={prop.author} />
                <div className="UserInfo-name">
                    {props.author.name}
                </div>
            </div>
            <div className="Comment-text">
                {props.text}
            </div>
            <div className="Comment-date">
                {formatDate(prop.date)}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Next, we will extract a UserInfo component that renders an Avatar next to the user's name:

```jsx
function UserInfo(props) {
    return (
        <div className="UserInfo">
            <Avatar user={props.user} />
            <div className="UserInfo-name">
                {props.user.name}
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

This lets us simplify Comment even further:

```jsx
function Comment(props) {
    return (
        <div className="Comment">
            <UserInfo user={props.author} />
            <div className="Comment-text">
                {props.text}
            </div>
            <div className="Comment-date">
                {formateDate(props.date)}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Extracting components might seem like grunt work at first, but having a palette fo reusable components pays off in large apps. A goor rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several time (Button, Panpel, Avatar), or is complex enough its own (App, FeedStory, Comment), it is a good candidate to be a reusable component.

## Props are Read-Only

Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function:

```jsx
function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Such function are call "pure" because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the smae result for the same inputs.

In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:

```jsx
function withdraw(account, amount) {
    account.total -= amount;
}
```

React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:

All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. In the next section, we will introduce a new concept of "state". State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.
