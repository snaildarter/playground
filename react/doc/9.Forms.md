# Forms

HTMl form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form inplain HTML accepts a single name:

```jsx
<form>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input type="text" name="name" />
  </label>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it jusi works. But in most cases, it's convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has assess to the date that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called 'ontrolled components';

## Controlled Components

In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

We can combine the two by making the React state be the "single source of truth". Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in the way is called a "controlled component".

For example, if we want to make the previous example log the name when it is submitted, we can write the form as a controlled component:

```jsx
class NameForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: ''};

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Name:
          <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

Since the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be this.state.value, making the React state the source of truth, Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.

With a controlled component, every state mutaion will have an associated handler function. This makes it straightforward to modify or validate user input. For example, if we wanted to enforce that names are written with all uppercase letters, we could write handleChange as:

```jsx
handleChange(event) {
  this.setState({value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()});
}
```

## The textarea Tag

In HTML, a <textarea> element defines its text by its children:

```jsx
<textarea>
  Hello there, this is some text in a text area
</textarea>
```

In React, a <textarea> uses a value attribute insted. This way, a form using a <textarea> can be writen vary similarly to a form that uses a single-line input:

```jsx
class EssayForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: 'Please write an essay about your favorite DOM element.'
    };

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('An essay was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Essay:
          <textarea value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

Notice that this.state.value is initalized in the constructor, so that the text area starts off with some text in it.

## The select Tag

In  HTML, <select> creates a drop-down list, For example, this HTML creates a drop-down list of flavors:

```jsx
<select>
  <option value="grapefruit">Grapefruit</option>
  <option value="lime">Lime</option>
  <option selected value="coconut">Coconut</option>
  <option value="mango">Mango</option>
</select>
```

Note that the Coconut option is initally selected, because of the selected attribute, React, instead of using this selected attribute, uses a value attribute on the root select tag. This is more convenient in a controlled component because you only need to update it in one place. For Example:

```jsx
class FlavorForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: 'coconut'};

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('Your favorite flavor is: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Pick your favorite flavor:
          <select value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange}>
            <option value="grapefruit">Grapefruit</option>
            <option value="lime">Lime</option>
            <option value="coconut">Coconut</option>
            <option value="mango">Mango</option>
          </select>
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

Overall, this makes it so that <input type="text">, <textarea>, and <select> all work very similary-they all accept a value attribute that you can use to implement a controlled component.

> Note
> 
> You can pass an array into the value attribute, allowing you to select multiple options in a select tag:
> ```jsx <select multiple={true} value={['B', 'C']}> ```

## The file input Tag

In HTML, an <input type="file"> lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage to be uploaded to a server or manipulated by JavaScript via the File API.

```jsx
<input type="file" />
```

Because its value is read-only, it is uncontrolled component in React. it is discussed together with other uncontrolled components later in the documentation.

## Handing Multiple inputs

When you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.

For Example:

```jsx
class Reservation extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      isGoing: true,
      numberOfGuests: 2
    };

    this.handleInputChange = this.handleInputChange.bind(this);
  }

  handleInputChange(event) {
    const target = event.target;
    const value = target.type === 'checkbox' ? target.checked : target.value;
    const name = target.name;

    this.setState({
      [name]: value
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form>
        <label>
          Is going:
          <input
            name="isGoing"
            type="checkbox"
            checked={this.state.isGoing}
            onChange={this.handleInputChange} />
        </label>
        <br />
        <label>
          Number of guests:
          <input
            name="numberOfGuests"
            type="number"
            value={this.state.numberOfGuests}
            onChange={this.handleInputChange} />
        </label>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

Note how we used the ES6 computed property name syntax to update the state key corresponding to the given input name:

```jsx
this.setState({
  [name]: value
});
```

It is equivalent to this ES5 code:

```jsx
var partialState = {};
partialState[name] = value;
this.setState(partialState);
```

Also, sine setStae() automatically merges a partial state into the current state, we only needed to call it with the changed parts.

## Controlled Input Null Value

Specifying the value prop on a controlled component prevents the user from changing the input unless you desire so. If you're specified a value but the input is still editable, you may have accidentally set value to undefined of null.

The folloeing code demonstrates this. (The input is locked at first but becomes editable after a short delay.)

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<input value="hi" />, mountNode);

setTimeout(function() {
  ReactDOM.render(<input value={null} />, mountNode);
}, 1000);
```

## Alternatives to Controlled Components

It can something be tedious to use controlled components, because you need to write an event handler for every way your data can change and pipe all of the input state through a React component. This can become particularly annoying when you are converting a preexisting codebase to React, or intergrating a React application with a non-React library. In these situations, you might want to check out uncontrolled components, an alternative technique for implementing input forms.
